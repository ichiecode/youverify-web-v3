        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          <br />This Website Data Usage and Cookie Policy explains how we
          collect and use information on our websites or when you otherwise
          interact with us. For details about the information we collect and use
          when we verify an identity or carry out checks related to an identity
          (our “Verification Services”), please see the Youverify Privacy
          Policy. Please review this Website Data Usage and Cookie Policy
          periodically as we may modify it from time to time. If we make any
          material changes, we’ll notify you, which may include posting a notice
          on our website and/or sending you an email.

        <h3>
          Information We Collect on Our Website or When You Otherwise Interact
          With Us:
        </h3>

        <p>
          We collect the information you decide to provide when browsing our

          number, CV and related job application information (including results
          of a background check – if applicable), company information, billing
          and purchase<br />information, and any other information you choose to

          information from you when browsing our website. This includes:
        </p>

        <h3>Log Information</h3>

        <p>
          We log information about your use of the website, including the type
          of browser you use, access times, and your IP address.
        </p>

        <h3>Device Information</h3>

        <p>
          We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to
          access our web platform, including the hardware model, operating
          system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network
          information.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
        </h3>

        <p>
          We and our service providers use various technologies to collect
          information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data
          files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us
          improve our website and your experience, see which areas and features
          of our website are popular and count visits. Web beacons are
          electronic images that may be used on our website or emails and help
          deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign
          effectiveness. For more information about cookies, and how to disable
          them, please see below.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>

        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide, maintain and improve the website;</li>
          <li>
            Provide and deliver the services you request, process transactions
            and send you related information, including confirmations and
            invoices;
          </li>
          <li>Process your verification request;</li>
          <li>
            Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and
            administrative messages; • Respond to your comments, questions and
            requests and provide customer service;
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions,
            rewards, and events offered by Youverify and others, and provide
            news and information we think will be of interest to you;
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor and analyse trends, usage and activities in connection with
            the websites; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We use information for the above purposes where it is necessary for
          the performance of a contract to which an individual is subject, where
          it is Sharing of Information necessary in our legitimate interest to
          do so, where we have a legal obligation, or where an individual has
          provided their consent. We share information with external parties
          that are performing tasks on our behalf (including our affiliates) and
          with other companies, organisations, and individuals outside Youverify
          where we have a legitimate legal reason for so-doing (for example, in
          connection with any merger or acquisition).
        </p>

        <p>
          Whenever legally possible, we seek to protect the information we share
          by imposing contractual privacy and security safeguards on the
          recipient of the information. This is particularly important in cases
          where the recipient is located in a country that has different or
          lesser privacy laws than those of the country where the information
          was originally collected. In some cases, however, it’s not possible
          for us to do so — for example, when we have a legal obligation to
          disclose information to a government authority and that government
          authority isn’t willing to enter into such contractual safeguards.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Party Payment Processing</h3>

        <p>
          We rely on Paystack, a third-party payment partner, to accept payments
          on our behalf. We do not directly store any payment card details. All
          payment information necessary to complete a payment transaction is
          provided directly to Paystack. For more information about how Paystack
          processes payment card data, please see Paystack’s Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Storage</h3>

        <p>
          We use the following cookies on the website: We store the information
          described in this Website Data Usage and Cookie Policy only for as
          long as necessary to fulfill the purposes identified above. For
          example, we maintain website log data for a brief period of time, but
          we retain communications we may have with individuals for much longer
          to ensure that we can continue to service those individuals on an
          ongoing basis.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Security</h3>

        <p>
          Youverify takes appropriate administrative, physical, technical and
          organizational measures designed to help protect information about
          users from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration and destruction. For more information about information
          security at Youverify, you can request for a copy of our information
          security policy at security@youverify.co . If you think you have
          identified a security vulnerability or bug in our Verification
          Services, please report it to the Youverify security team at
          security@youverify.co
