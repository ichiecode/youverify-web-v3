        <p>
          Youverify’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its
          right to do so later. If a provision is found invalid or
          unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in
          full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our
          intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights
          under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Youverify may
          assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any
          successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
        </p>

        <h3>6.4 Changes To The Services</h3>

        <p>
          We reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to
          amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Services, the Content, and
          any part thereof without notice to you. Youverify shall have no
          liability to you or any other person or entity for any modification,
          suspension, termination, or loss of information.
        </p>

        <h3>6.5 Term And Termination</h3>

        <p>
          These Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the
          Services. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time. We
          can suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Services, in
          whole or in part, at any time, immediately and without notice. In all
          such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation,
          your license to use the Services, except that the following sections
          shall continue to apply: 3, 5, and 6. Nothing in this section shall
          affect Youverify’s right to change, limit, or stop the provision of
          the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 6.4.
        </p>

        <h3>6.6 Headings</h3>

        <p>
          The headings of the sections contained in these Terms are for
          convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect the
          meaning or construction of any provision of the Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>6.7 Modification Of Terms</h3>

        <p>
          From time to time, and in our sole discretion, we may revise these
          Terms. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will
          notify you via an email sent to the email address associated with your
          account, or by means of a notice posted on this website. By continuing
          to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective,
          you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>6.8 Notification</h3>

        <p>
          By entering into and accepting these Terms, you agree and consent to
          receive electronically all communications, agreements, notices,
          documents and disclosures relating to these Terms and your use of the
          Services (collectively, “Communications”). Communications include
          agreements and policies you agree to (for example, and not by way of
          limitation, these Terms, including the Privacy Policy), including
          updates to these agreements or policies; annual disclosures;
          transaction receipts or confirmations; statements and transaction
          history; and any other transaction information or other information
          related to the Services. You have the right to withdraw your consent
          at any time. To withdraw consent, you may send a written request (a)
          by regular mail to Youverify at 13B Bishop Street, Off Coker road,
          Ilupeju, Lagos or (b) by email to privacy@youverify.co. If consent is
          withdrawn, Youverify reserves the right to discontinue your access to
          the Services, terminate any and all agreements with you, and/or charge
          you additional fees for paper copies.
        </p>

        <h3>6.9 Entire Agreement</h3>

        <p>
          These Terms, as well as the incorporated Privacy Policy, Payment
          Policy, and Additional Service Terms you agree to, are the entire and
          exclusive agreement between you and Youverify, and these Terms
          supersede and replace any prior agreements between Youverify and you
          regarding the Services. However, the foregoing does not supersede or
          replace any Master Services Agreement, Order Form, or other written
          agreement between you and Youverify, which is explicitly in addition
          to or replaces these Terms. These Terms create no third-party
          beneficiary rights.
